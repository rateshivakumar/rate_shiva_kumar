✅ Phase-1 (First 6 Months) – 9 Solid DevOps Projects

This document contains:

Clear explanation of all 9 solid projects

What to build, what to break, what to fix

Skills gained from each project

A printable checklist you can tick weekly/monthly

You can print this or keep it as a progress tracker.

📅 HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT DAY‑WISE (VERY IMPORTANT)

⚠️ Important clarification: This canvas currently shows PROJECTS, not daily tasks.

Your DAY‑WISE tasks come from the 6‑MONTH PLAN we discussed in chat (Linux → AWS → Docker → K8s → Terraform).

To make this document usable day by day, use the system below.

🧭 STEP 1: IDENTIFY TODAY (DO THIS DAILY)

Every day, ask yourself 3 things:

Month (1 to 6)

Week (1 to 4)

Day (1 to 5 – weekdays)

📌 Example:

Month 1 → Week 1 → Day 3

🗂️ STEP 2: MAP DAY → WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

Use this fixed mapping:

🔹 MONTH 1 – LINUX + NOC

Week 1 – Linux Basics

Day 1: Linux install + basic commands

Day 2: Users, groups, permissions

Day 3: Package management (apt/yum), install nginx

Day 4: Processes, services (ps, top, systemctl)

Day 5: Logs (/var/log, journalctl)

Week 2 – Linux Admin & Scripting

Day 1: Shell variables

Day 2: Conditions & loops

Day 3: Write small scripts

Day 4: Cron jobs & automation

Day 5: Linux troubleshooting

Week 3 – Git & GitHub

Day 1: git clone, add, commit

Day 2: branching & merge

Day 3: conflicts

Day 4: GitHub workflow

Day 5: Repo cleanup

Week 4 – NOC → DevOps Mapping

Day 1–5: Monitoring, alerts, incidents, SLAs + notes

🔹 MONTH 2–3 – AWS CORE

IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, ALB, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch

👉 Each day = one AWS concept + hands‑on + screenshots

🔹 MONTH 4 – DOCKER + CI/CD

Docker basics → Dockerfile → Docker Compose

Jenkins → Pipeline → Jenkinsfile

🔹 MONTH 5 – KUBERNETES

Pods → Deployments → Services

ConfigMaps → Secrets → Ingress → HPA

🔹 MONTH 6 – TERRAFORM + MONITORING

Terraform basics

Monitoring (CloudWatch / Prometheus / Grafana)

⏱️ STEP 3: DAILY 2.5‑HOUR RULE (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

For any day, follow this exact format:

30 min → Watch only today’s topic video

90 min → Hands‑on practice

30 min → Break/fix + GitHub commit

If GitHub has a commit → ✅ Day completed

✅ STEP 4: USE PROJECTS AS WEEKEND / END‑OF‑MONTH WORK

This canvas document (Projects 1–9) is used when:

Weekend

End of a month

Revision

Daily learning feeds into these projects.

📝 HOW TO WRITE EACH PROJECT README (VERY IMPORTANT)

Every project README should have this format:

1️⃣ Project Overview

What the project is

Why it is needed in real production

2️⃣ Architecture / Flow

Diagram (draw.io / screenshots)

3️⃣ Tools Used

Linux / AWS / Docker / Kubernetes / Terraform etc.

4️⃣ What I Implemented

Step-by-step (high level)

5️⃣ Failure Scenarios Tested

What broke

How you detected it

How you fixed it

6️⃣ Key Learnings

Real DevOps takeaways

🎯 WHY THIS STRUCTURE WORKS (INTERVIEW SECRET)

When an interviewer opens your GitHub:

They see clear organization

They see troubleshooting focus

They see production thinking

This screams:

“This person has worked on real systems.”

🚨 IMPORTANT RULES

❌ Do NOT dump random files

❌ Do NOT skip README

✅ Every project must show problem → fix

✅ Commit regularly with meaningful messages

🏁 FINAL ADVICE

If you complete these 9 projects and structure GitHub like this:

You don’t need to say “3 years experience” loudly

Your GitHub will say it for you

Next Recommended Step:

Resume bullet points mapped from these 9 projects

Interview questions from each project

Just say 👉 NEXT: RESUME + INTERVIEW MAPPING
